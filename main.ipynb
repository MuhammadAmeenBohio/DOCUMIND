      "John Felix Anthony Cena (/ˈsiːnə/ SEE-nə; born April 23, 1977)[11] is an American actor and professional wrestler. As a wrestler, he has been signed to WWE since 2001[update], and is a record 16-time world champion as recognized by WWE alongside Ric Flair.[a] He is widely regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time.[12][13][14]\n",
      "Cena moved to California in 1998 to pursue a bodybuilding career and switched to professional wrestling in 1999, making his debut for Ultimate Pro Wrestling (UPW). In 2001, he signed with WWE (then WWF) and was assigned to its developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), where he won the OVW Heavyweight Championship and OVW Southern Tag Team Championship.[15][16] After moving up to WWE's main roster on SmackDown in 2002, he became a breakout success after adopting the character of a villainous trash-talking rapper.[17][18] After winning his first WWE Championship in 2005, he underwent a face turn into a clean-cut heroic character, which he described as a \"goody-two shoes Superman\".[19] Cena led the company as its franchise player[20] and public face from the mid-2000s to the late 2010s.[21]\n",
      "Cena has held the WWE Championship a record 13 times and the World Heavyweight Championship three times. He is also a five-time WWE United States Champion, a two-time WWE Tag Team Champion, a two-time World Tag Team Champion, a two-time Royal Rumble winner, and a one-time Money in the Bank winner. He has headlined multiple major WWE pay-per-views, including its flagship event WrestleMania five times (22, 23, 27, 28 and 29). His career has been met with mixed critical and audience reception, with praise for his character work and promotional skills but criticism for his perceived over-representation and on-screen dominance relative to other wrestlers.[20]\n",
      "Cena's first starring film role was in The Marine (2006) and he gained praise for his performances in Trainwreck (2015), Ferdinand (2017), Blockers (2018), and Bumblebee (2018).[22] He starred in F9 (2021) and Fast X (2023) and portrayed Peacemaker in The Suicide Squad (2021) and the eponymous television series (2022–present). He released his only studio album, You Can't See Me, in 2005, which peaked at number 15 on the Billboard 200. Outside of his work in entertainment, Cena is known for his involvement in charitable causes, and has granted the most wishes for the Make-A-Wish Foundation at over 650.[23]\n",

      "Early life\n",
      "John Felix Anthony Cena was born in West Newbury, Massachusetts, on April 23, 1977,[7] to Carol (née Lupien) and former Chaotic Wrestling ring announcer John Joseph Cena.[7][24] His mother is of English and French-Canadian descent, while his father has Italian ancestry.[25] He has one older brother named Dan and three younger brothers named Matt, Steve, and Sean.[26] He was raised Catholic. His maternal grandfather was baseball player Tony Lupien,[27] while his maternal great-grandfather was businessman Ulysses J. Lupien.[25] He is also a cousin of computer scientist Natalie Enright Jerger. A childhood fan of wrestling, he would create championship belts out of cardboard for himself and his brothers.[24] He was teased and beaten up while in school, prompting him to ask his parents for a weightlifting bench at the age of 12.[25]\n",
      "Cena was educated at Central Catholic High School in Lawrence, Massachusetts, before transferring to the private prep boarding school Cushing Academy in Ashburnham, Massachusetts. He then attended Springfield College in Springfield, Massachusetts,[28] where he was an NCAA Division III All-American center and football team captain.[29][30] He graduated in 1999 with a degree in exercise physiology and body movement,[31] after which he pursued a bodybuilding career[30] and worked as a limousine driver.[32] He also worked in the store area of Gold's Gym.[33]\n",

      "In 2001, Cena signed a developmental contract with the WWF and was assigned to its developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW).[7][39] During his time there, he continued to wrestle as The Prototype and held the OVW Heavyweight Championship for three months and the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship (with Rico Constantino)[30][34] for two months.[15][16] Throughout the early months of 2002, Cena found himself competing on house shows for the WWF, where he wrestled against the likes of Shelton Benjamin and Tommy Dreamer. After his main roster call-up in June 2002, he continued to appear on OVW programming until September 25, when he lost to Kenny Brolin in a Loser Leaves OVW match. He would later appear in a one-off appearance for the developmental farm in November under the ring name Mr. P in a six-man tag team match, where he teamed with Hall of Famer Big Boss Man and Charlie Haas in a winning effort against Lance Cade, Trevor Murdoch, and Sean O'Haire.[39]\n",

      "In October, Cena and Billy Kidman failed to win a tag team tournament to crown the first WWE Tag Team Champions of the SmackDown! brand in the first round.[41] The next week on SmackDown!, Cena turned on and attacked Kidman, blaming him for their loss and turning heel for the first and only time in his WWE career.[40] On the October 17 episode of SmackDown!, Cena defeated Kidman,[42] but lost in a rematch the next week.[43] At Rebellion on October 26, Cena and Dawn Marie lost to Kidman and Torrie Wilson in a mixed tag team match.[44] Shortly after, on a Halloween-themed episode of SmackDown!, Cena dressed as Vanilla Ice, performing a freestyle rap.[40] The following week on SmackDown!, Cena received a new character: a rapper who cut promos while rhyming.[40][7] He used the nickname \"The Doctor of Thuganomics\" and expanded his gimmick to include rapping before his matches, wearing hats and sports jerseys as part of his ring gear.[7] While on a bus journey with other WWE superstars, Cena was involved in a freestyle rap session with Rikishi and Rey Mysterio, impressing Stephanie McMahon, leading to the gimmick's adoption.[18] As the character evolved, Cena began adopting a variant of the 1980s WWF logo—dropping the \"F\"—as his \"signature symbol\", along with the slogan \"Word Life\".[45] Moreover, he was joined by an enforcer, Bull Buchanan, who was rechristened to B-2 (also written B² and pronounced \"B-Squared\").[7] Buchanan was replaced with Red Dogg until he was sent to the Raw brand in February.[7][40]\n",

Two quick spears allowed Edge to pin Cena and win the championship.[79] Cena won the title back on January 29 at Royal Rumble.[79] After that, Cena began feuding with Triple H. The crowd, which had mostly cheered Cena over the previous few months, started booing him again and cheering the villain Triple H.[7] Cena beat Triple H at WrestleMania 22 on April 2 to retain the title.[80] The negative reaction towards him intensified when he faced Rob Van Dam at ECW One Night Stand on June 11 which took place in front of a boisterous crowd of mostly original ECW fans at the Hammerstein Ballroom. Cena was met with raucous jeering and chants of \"Fuck you, Cena\", \"You can't wrestle\", and \"Same old shit\". When he began performing different moves as the match progressed, the fans started chanting \"You still suck\".[7] Cena lost the WWE Championship to Van Dam after interference from Edge.[81]\n",

      "On the heels of his feud with Edge, Cena was placed in an inter-brand angle to determine the \"Champion of Champions\"—or which was the most dominant champion in WWE's three brands. Cena, World Heavyweight Champion King Booker, and ECW World Champion Big Show were booked in a triple threat match at Cyber Sunday, with the viewers voting on which of the three championships would be placed on the line.[85] At the same time, Cena was involved in a storyline with non-wrestler Kevin Federline, who appeared on Raw with Johnny Nitro and Melina. After getting into a worked physical altercation with Federline on Raw,[7] Federline appeared on November 5 at Cyber Sunday to hit Cena with the World Heavyweight Championship during the match, helping King Booker retain his title.[81] On the January 1 episode of Raw, Cena was pinned by Federline with an assist from Umaga.[86] At New Year's Revolution on January 7, 2007, Cena defeated Umaga to end his undefeated streak and retain the WWE Championship.[87][88] At Royal Rumble on January 28, Cena retained the title against Umaga in a Last Man Standing match.[89]\n",

The Hardys (Matt and Jeff) won the match and the titles.[92] Cena retained the WWE Championship against Michaels, Orton, and Edge in a fatal four-way match on April 29 at Backlash.[93] The Great Khali then declared his intentions to challenge for Cena's championship, attacking and \"laying out\" all three of the top contenders before assaulting Cena and stealing the title belt.[94][95] On May 20 at Judgment Day, Cena became the first person to defeat Khali by submission[96] and then by pinfall on June 3 at One Night Stand in a Falls Count Anywhere match.[97] Cena retained the WWE Championship in a five-pack challenge on June 24 at Vengeance: Night of Champions,[98] and against Bobby Lashley on July 22 at The Great American Bash.[99] Later that summer, Randy Orton was named the #1 contender for Cena's championship.[100] Leading up to SummerSlam on August 26, Orton delivered a number of sneak-attacks, performing three RKOs to Cena, who in the actual match at SummerSlam, retained the championship.[101] A rematch took place at Unforgiven on September 16, which Orton won by disqualification after Cena ignored the referee's instructions and continued to beat on him in the corner.[102]\n",

At the time, it was estimated this would require six months to a year of rehabilitation.[104][105] As a result, Cena was stripped of the title by Mr. McMahon on the next night's episode of ECW,[106] ending the longest WWE Championship reign in over 19 years.[7] Cena's surgery was performed by orthopedic surgeon James Andrews at St. Vincent's Hospital in Birmingham, Alabama.[103] Two weeks later in a video update on WWE.com, Dr. Andrews and Cena's physical trainer both said that he was several weeks ahead of where he was expected to be in his rehabilitation at that time.[107]\n",

      "After Elimination Chamber, Bray Wyatt accepted Cena's challenge for a WrestleMania XXX match.[219] Wyatt wanted to prove that Cena's heroic act was a façade characteristic of \"this era of lies\" and to turn Cena into a \"monster\".[220] At WrestleMania on April 6, Cena defeated Wyatt despite interference from Luke Harper and Erick Rowan.[221] The feud continued after WrestleMania based on the story that Wyatt was capturing Cena's fanbase, exemplified by Wyatt leading a children's choir to the ring on the April 28 episode of Raw, where they later donned sheep masks.[222] At Extreme Rules on May 4, Wyatt defeated Cena in a steel cage match after repeated interference from the rest of the Wyatt Family members and a demonic child.[223] At Payback on June 1, Cena defeated Wyatt in a well received Last Man Standing match to end their feud; Cena buried Wyatt under multiple equipment cases to win the match.[224]\n",

Despite this, he became the first wrestler to defeat Lesnar in two WWE pay-per-view events.[228] Cena then began feuding with Dean Ambrose for the right to face Rollins at Hell in a Cell on October 26, but Ambrose won the right by defeating Cena in a No Holds Barred Contract on a Pole match.[229] Cena faced Randy Orton instead in a Hell in a Cell match to determine the #1 contender for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, which Cena won.[230]\n",

At Survivor Series on November 23, Big Show turned on Cena, causing his elimination, but Ziggler eventually won the match for Team Cena with the interfering Sting's help. Per the match stipulation, The Authority were stripped from power and only Cena could bring them back.[232] At TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs on December 14, Cena defeated Rollins in a tables match to retain his WWE World Heavyweight Championship #1 contender status. It was then announced that Cena would face Lesnar for the title at the Royal Rumble.[233] On the December 29 episode of Raw, Rollins and Big Show held guest host Edge hostage, forcing Cena to reinstate The Authority.[234] On the January 5 episode of Raw, The Authority added Rollins to the title match at Royal Rumble involving Cena and Lesnar. Ziggler, Ryback and Rowan were \"fired\" for joining Team Cena at Survivor Series.[235] On the January 19 episode of Raw, Cena won a handicap match against Rollins, Big Show and Kane to retain his title shot at the Royal Rumble and win back the jobs of Ziggler, Ryback and Rowan.[236] At the Royal Rumble on January 25, Cena was unsuccessful in capturing the title.[237]\n",

Rusev had hit Cena with a low blow following a distraction by his manager Lana.[238] Cena challenged Rusev to a rematch, which was declined, and Stephanie McMahon decreed that Cena would not compete at WrestleMania 31 unless Rusev agreed to a rematch.[239] On the March 9 episode of Raw, Cena attacked Rusev, refusing to release the STF submission hold, causing Lana to grant Cena the match.[240] Cena defeated Rusev at WrestleMania on March 29 to win his fourth United States Championship, marking Rusev's first pinfall loss in the main roster.[241]\n",

On the July 27 episode of Raw, The Authority forced Cena to defend the title against Rollins, which he did successfully despite suffering a legitimate broken nose during the match.[256] Cena then faced Rollins in a \"Winner Takes All\" match at SummerSlam on August 23, for both the WWE World Heavyweight Championship and the United States Championship, which Cena lost after guest host Jon Stewart, appearing to side with Cena, attacked him with a steel chair, ending Cena's reign at 147 days.[257]\n",

The Miz's wife Maryse then slapped Cena before Cena and his girlfriend Nikki Bella sent The Miz and Maryse retreating.[282] SmackDown General Manager Daniel Bryan then set up a mixed tag team match for WrestleMania 33 on April 2,[283] which Cena and Bella won.

At the time, Cena was in Canada filming the HBO Max series Peacemaker, and the pandemic made it logistically impossible for him to travel to Tampa, Florida, for WrestleMania 37, as upon his return to Canada, he would have had to quarantine for two weeks, which would have shut down production on the series.[304] Cena did, however, appear in a WWE advertisement to help announce the location of WrestleMania 39. He finally made his return to WWE programming at Money in the Bank on July 18, 2021, confronting Roman Reigns after the latter retained his Universal Championship against Edge in the main event.[305] Following this, WWE announced the Summer of Cena tour, confirming Cena had signed a 25-appearance deal.[306] After initially being scheduled to face Finn Bálor for the title,[307] Cena ultimately highjacked a contract signing on the July 30 episode of SmackDown so he would challenge Reigns at SummerSlam.[308][309] At the event on August 21, Reigns defeated Cena after a back-and-forth contest.[310]\n",

He often rapped before his matches, insulting his opponents, events that happened in the media and even the crowd.[7] He also regularly performed \"rap battles\", where he and his opponent took turns rapping on each other.[18] In 2006, shortly after his debut film, The Marine, his wrestling character shifted from that of a rapper to a young military upstart, wearing dog tags and cargo shorts to the ring and also performing a salute to the crowd. Cena said in a 2011 interview with WWE.com that \"every night when I do that salute, it's also a sign of respect to the men and women that don the uniform of the Armed Forces.\"[334]\n",

Earn it\".[33][335][337] He has a history of returning from both real and scripted injuries much sooner than expected. ESPN reporter David Shoemaker said in April 2016, \"Never underestimate Cena's recuperative abilities. He's somewhere on the recovery scale between German platelet-rich plasma therapy and Deadpool\".[338] Fellow wrestler Big Show said he felt most stable being lifted by Cena, despite Cena being over 200 lbs lighter and almost a foot shorter—a testament to Cena's functional strength.[339]\n",

Cena started out wearing \"throwback jerseys\" and Reebok pumps until WWE produced specific Cena merchandise which he began wearing.[17][340] While Cena was a member of the SmackDown brand, one of his WWE-produced T-shirts bore the suggestive spoonerism \"Ruck Fules\". Whenever it appeared on television, the image was censored, not by the network, but by WWE to sell more shirts under the premise that it was \"too hot for TV\".[341] He also wore a chain with a large padlock, occasionally using it as a weapon,[64] until WrestleMania 21, when it was replaced with a chromed and diamond studded \"Chain Gang\" spinner medallion matching his spinner title belt.\n",

      "Cena was featured on the ABC reality series Fast Cars and Superstars: The Gillette Young Guns Celebrity Race, which aired in June 2007,[384] making it to the final round before being eliminated on June 24, placing third in the competition overall.[385]\n",
      "In 2007, Cena was interviewed for the CNN Special Investigations Unit documentary Death Grip: Inside Pro Wrestling, which focused on steroid and drug use in professional wrestling. When asked if he had taken steroids he was heard to reply, \"I can't tell you that I haven't, but you will never prove that I have\".[386] The day after the documentary aired, WWE accused CNN of taking Cena's comments out of context to present a biased point of view, backing up their claim by posting an unedited video of Cena answering the same question – filmed by WWE cameras from another angle – in which he is heard beginning the same statement with \"absolutely not\".[387] A text interview on the website with Cena later had him saying the news outlet should apologize for misrepresenting him,[388] which CNN refused, saying they felt the true answer to the question began with the phrase \"my answer to that question\".[389] However, they did edit the documentary on subsequent airings to include the \"absolutely not\".[389]\n",

Cena accepted the dare, but did it in reverse by waving his hand in front of his face instead to make it look more visible to his brother.[26] Over time, this evolved into his signature catchphrase \"You Can't See Me\".[424] In mid-2015, Cena was the subject of the Internet meme \"Unexpected John Cena\", also known as simply \"Unexpected Cena\" or \"IT'S JOHN CENA\".[425] He has also been the subject of many memes due to his catchphrase, \"You can't see me\" such as being invisible in photos.[426]\n",
